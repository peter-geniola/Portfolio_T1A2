            <h1>Peter Geniola</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Peter Geniola and wlecome to my very first experience at website design and development.  </p>
            <p>Website design and development has been an interest of mine for a long time. Originally working in the trades sector as a painter and decorator where I've taken on various roles from architectural and protective coatings to domestic and commercial enterprise. </p>
            <p>My interest in coding and website design and development came through about five years ago, after I completed college. My college studies were done over three years, by distance when I was an adult in my early to mid thirties. I put a main focus in mathematics with some computers and sciences as well and attempted a university degree in mathematics itself. But, unfortunately due to personal circumstances I had to withdraw from the course, in the first year, and pursue a career back in the painting and decorating industry. </p>
            <p>In between painting projects in over the last five or so years I have still managed to keep my studies active by engaging in online courses delivered by organisations such as Coursera and EDX which is where I found my passion for coding. </p>
            <p>My vision for the future would be to engage and develop my skills as a programming professional and hopefully one day land myself a senior role.</p>
